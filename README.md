# Spring Boot 6 Template Project

## Introduction
This project serves as a template for Spring Boot 6 applications. It provides a solid foundation for quickly starting new Spring Boot projects with pre-configured settings and best practices.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Git
- JDK 21 or later
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any preferred IDE
- Docker account (for image publishing)

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup
1. In GitHub, create a new project using this template.
2. In the new project's Settings:
    - Enable 'Automatically delete head branches'
    - Enable 'Always suggest updating pull request branches'
3. Set Branch Protection Rules similar to this template project. Do not Lock Master branch there.

### 2. Local Development Setup
1. Clone the newly created project.
2. Configure Maven settings in your IDE:
    - Point to a valid `settings.xml` for GitHub dependency resolution.
    - Set local Maven repository outside of Microsoft's cloud (e.g., `C:\development\tools\maven-repo`).
3. Create a feature branch for your changes.

### 3. Project Customization
1. Search for TODOs in the project and update the following:
    - Rename `group-id` and `artifact-id` in `pom.xml`
    - Update `name` in `application.yaml`
    - Ensure all names match your GitHub project name
2. Rename packages and classes as needed.

### 4. GitHub Configuration
1. Add the following secrets in your GitHub project Action settings:
    - `DOCKER_USER`
    - `DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    - `SONAR_TOKEN`: a Sonar Token generated in https://sonarcloud.io. Sonar Analysis Method: Automatic Analysis disabled. 
    - `RELEASE_TOKEN`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with permissions to push to the master branch
    - To create this token:
        1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
        2. Click "Generate new token" (classic)
        3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Release Token for [Your Project Name]")
        4. Set the expiration as needed
        5. Select at least these scopes: `repo`, `write:packages`
        6. Generate the token and copy it immediately
    - Add this token as a secret named `RELEASE_TOKEN` in your repository settings
2. Add the following vars in your GitHub project Action settings:
    - CI_USER and set value to dboeckli@gmail.com
    - CI_USER_EMAIL set value to dboeckli@gmail.com
3. Add the following secrets in your GitHub project Dependent Bot settings:
   - `DOCKER_USER`
   - `DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### 5. Build and Deployment
1. Trigger a rebuild in GitHub Actions.
2. Upon successful build:
    - A Docker image will be pushed to GitHub Packages and Docker Hub.
    - Access your Docker Hub repository: https://hub.docker.com/repositories/domboeckli
    - Change the Docker Hub image visibility from private to public to unlock it.

### 6. Release
To create a new release:

1. Ensure you are on the main branch and it is up to date:
2. Run the release workflow:
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Navigate to the "Actions" tab
- Select the "Maven Release" workflow
- Click "Run workflow"
- Choose the main branch and click "Run workflow"
3. The workflow will:
- Check if you're on the main branch
- Verify that the current version is a SNAPSHOT
- Prepare the release (update versions, create tag)
- Perform the release (build, test, and deploy)
- Push changes back to the repository
4. After the workflow completes successfully:
- A new release tag will be created in your repository
- The project version in pom.xml will be updated
- A new Docker image with the release version will be pushed to Docker Hub
5. Verify the release:
- Check the releases page on GitHub
- Confirm the new version in pom.xml on the main branch
- Verify the new Docker image on Docker Hub

Note: Ensure all required secrets (RELEASE_TOKEN, DOCKER_USER, DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN) are properly set in your GitHub repository settings before running the release workflow.

## Deployment with Kubernetes

To run maven filtering for destination target/k8s
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests 
```

Deployment goes into the default namespace.

To deploy all resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -f target/k8s/
```

To remove all resources:
```bash
kubectl delete -f target/k8s/
```

Check
```bash
kubectl get deployments -o wide
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

You can use the actuator rest call to verify via port 30080

## Deployment with Helm

Be aware that we are using a different namespace here (not default).

To run maven filtering for destination target/helm
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests 
```

Go to the directory where the tgz file has been created after 'mvn install'
```powershell
cd target/helm/repo
```

unpack
```powershell
$file = Get-ChildItem -Filter *.tgz | Select-Object -First 1
tar -xvf $file.Name
```

install
```powershell
$APPLICATION_NAME = Get-ChildItem -Directory | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -ge $file.LastWriteTime } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
helm upgrade --install $APPLICATION_NAME ./$APPLICATION_NAME --namespace spring-with-otel --create-namespace --wait --timeout 8m --debug --render-subchart-notes
```

show logs
```powershell
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=$APPLICATION_NAME -n spring-with-otel
```
replace $POD with pods from the command above
```powershell
kubectl logs $POD -n spring-with-otel --all-containers
```

test
```powershell
helm test $APPLICATION_NAME --namespace spring-with-otel --logs
```

uninstall
```powershell
helm uninstall $APPLICATION_NAME --namespace spring-with-otel
```

delete all
```powershell
kubectl delete all --all -n spring-with-otel
```

create busybox sidecar
```powershell
kubectl run busybox-test --rm -it --image=busybox:1.36 --namespace=spring-with-otel --command -- sh
```

You can use the actuator rest call to verify via port 30080
